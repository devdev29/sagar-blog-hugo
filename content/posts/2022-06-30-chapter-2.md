# Let the Coding Begin!

# Chapter 2: Weeks 1 and 2

Dr. Erwan let us know about the community's plan to conduct our projects in teams of two, based on our projects' similarities.

Thus a team between [Arunava Basu](https://github.com/arunavabasu-03) and I, and a team between [Tran Huu Nhat Huy](https://github.com/TranHuuNhatHuy) and [Supriya Kumari](https://github.com/Supriya1702) was formed.

Unfortunately, I fell sick midway through week 1. I tried to tackle smaller issues, but couldn't focus at all.
So, I cut myself some slack and took rest. Week 2 was similar, I couldn't get much stuff done. However, I put all my energy into getting better and also tried deepening my understanding of the RADIS code. Small challenges like resolving database path errors in ~/radis.json felt like huge wins!

Slowly but steadily, I began to solve the chunksize issue that was assigned to me. I looked at the various functions in broadening.py, and how they interact with each other. It was super interesting to see how all the functions were so useful, and how the computation of one parameter given certain constraints, utilized many of the functions.
