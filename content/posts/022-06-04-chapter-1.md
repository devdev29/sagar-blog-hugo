# Chapter 1

### Community Bonding Period

#### 20th May - 12th June, 2022

During the Community Bonding Period, I talked with my fellow RADIS GSoC participants and got to know their projects better. I also read the RADIS research paper and got to know about the physics behind the code.

It was around this time(27th May) that my exams got over, and naturally my family suggested that we go on a short vacation. Hence making time for GSoC was a bit difficult.

I steadily continued my progress in understanding the codebase, and also began tackling a challenge that Dr. Erwan mentioned to me: adding of a `chunksize` parameter in the [\_broaden_lines()](https://github.com/radis/radis/blob/b853a26b34a0b9b53670062a2214da4d134ec391/radis/lbl/broadening.py#L2115)function, present in the [broadening.py](https://github.com/radis/radis/blob/develop/radis/lbl/broadening.py) file.

I took some time understanding how the code was written and structured initially, and was quite impressed at the technique used to divide the database into chunks and process these chunks instead of individual lines. I thought it necessary to change a bit of the code structure, shifting the focus to the chunksize in terms of readability.

All in all, the Community Bonding Period was quite fun! I got to enjoy a bit of my post-exam "summer" break, and also spent some time coding.
